    <p>Rachelle is an accomplished industry professional with a vast knowledge of the luxury
spa and wellness market. Having gained 30 years of direct experience in the spa,
wellness, personal growth, health retreat and hospitality industries, along with
foundational studies in Interior Styling.


With a passion for spa and wellness, Rachelle's journeys have taken her to some of
the best destination spas, bathhouses and healing sanctuaries around the world. She
continues her professional development through her personal and professional
interests which lead her continually researching the global spa and wellness industry,
as well as holistic therapies, wellness technologies and personal and spiritual growth
programs. 


Rachelle began her career in wellness as a Massage and Thalasso Spa Practitioner
and then went onto Spa Management and finally made an organic entrance into
consulting when she was asked to manage pre-opening projects such as Four
Seasons Bora Bora and Belmond. From there several referrals led to more consulting
work for Sofitel Manila and Marriott France as well as the Olympic Bathhouse Spa in
London during the 2012 London Olympics.

Whether you’re looking to create a sanctuary space in your organisation to encourage workplace wellness, or if you’re designing a spa at your hotel or travel destination, Rachelle will bring a depth of experience, creative design sensibilities and a respect for the cultural/historical context of the region into a thoughtful product from vision to reality. 
Rachelle is available for freelance contracts locally to the UK and internationally, and can assist you from the set-up stage through to opening your spa.
