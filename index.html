<p>This place is wonderful. I had the best massage today and at the end felt like I was on a cloud. Very experienced therapist and totally Covid secure. Highly recommend it.

    <p>I recently had an extraordinary massage at Heal Studio with Rachelle. As I stepped in, tranquility enveloped me, setting the stage for a transformative experience. Rachelle's remarkable expertise was evident in her hands, which intuitively found muscle knots and tension points, leaving me physically, mentally, and emotionally rejuvenated. Heal Studio's serene ambiance enhanced the experience. If you seek more than a massage and desire a holistic healing journey, I wholeheartedly recommend Rachelle. Thank you for this exceptional experience.

        <p>Rachelle Ertlé has a wealth of experience managing various prestigious spas throughout the globe. Heal Studio is a discreetly located hidden gem off the beaten track in what is becoming recognised as the creative quarter of Barking. It is a tranquil oasis decorated in calming, muted colours that immediately create a relaxing atmosphere.A special mention must go to the lovely Head Therapist Virginie for her professionalism in alleviating the pain from my long-standing neck injury.
